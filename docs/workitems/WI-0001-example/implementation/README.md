# Implementation Notes: WI-0001-example

This is the implementation directory for the example workitem.

## Status
This workitem serves as a template demonstration. No actual code was implemented — the purpose is to show the full pipeline flow from Research through Implementation.

## Notes
- All pipeline stages were completed with example content
- See `research/00-research.md` for the research brief
- See `plan/` for the action plan, task breakdown, and test plan
- In a real workitem, this directory would contain implementation notes, decisions made during coding, and references to PRs
