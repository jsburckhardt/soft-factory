# WI-0002: README Cleanup

## Scope
Documentation cleanup

## Description
Remove template-specific content from README.md that was already covered in CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.md, leaving a clean starting point for new projects created from this template.

## Changes
- Replaced verbose template introduction with generic project placeholder
- Removed duplicate documentation about repository structure, workflow, and agents
- Added simple navigation links to CONTRIBUTING.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/
- Left clean, minimal README that projects can customize

## Rationale
The original README contained extensive template documentation that:
1. Is already comprehensively covered in CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.md
2. Should not be carried over when someone uses this as a template
3. Creates confusion between template meta-documentation and actual project documentation

The new README provides a clean slate for projects while maintaining links to the essential documentation.
