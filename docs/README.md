# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized by category.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `application/` | Application-specific documentation (API docs, user guides, etc.) |
| `architecture/` | Architectural decisions, core-components, and templates |
| `workitems/` | Workitem-scoped work following the Research → Architect → Plan → Implement pipeline |

## Conventions

- Every workitem follows the naming convention `WI-####-short-slug`
- ADRs and core-components are global and live under `architecture/`
- Templates are read-only references — copy and rename them, don't edit them directly
